# Neural Style Transfer

Implementation of Neural Style Transfer from the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) in Keras 2.0+

## Colaboratory Support

[This codebase can now be run directly from colaboratory using the following link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/laugh12321/neural-style/blob/master/NeuralStyleTransfer.ipynb), or by opening `NeuralStyleTransfer.ipynb`and visiting the Colab link.

Colab link supports almost all of the additional arguments, except of the masking ones. They will probably be added at a later date.

**NOTE :** Make sure you use a GPU in Colab or else the notebook will fail. To change Runtimes : `Runtime -> Change Runtime type ->`. Here select Python 3 and GPU as the hardware accelerator.
